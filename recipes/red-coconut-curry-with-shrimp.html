        <h1>Steps:</h1>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno and cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer veggies to a bowl and set aside.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium and add coconut milk, curry paste, brown sugar, and fish sauce to the pan. Whisk together and bring to a gentle boil.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Combine cornstarch and water in a small bowl; whisk to dissolve. Add to sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Pat shrimp dry and add to the sauce along with the cooked veggies. Allow curry to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are cooked through and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Top with Thai basil and serve with lime wedges.</p>
